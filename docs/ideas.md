Innovative Idea:

Our idea is a Campus Event Map, it allows people to see what kind of events are happening around campus and where they are located. 
Users can also log in to create events of their own, or rsvp to existing events. 
It is similar to social media sites such as Facebook, where people can post events to. It also has similar functionality to Snap Maps,
where people can see where events are happening. The main idea is creating a live event map but focused on the UMass Campus. 


Important Components:
There will be 3 types of Users: Event Planner (signed in user), Attendee (signed in user), Viewer (signed out user).
- Viewers can see the map and all the events. They can click on the pin to get the details. 
- Viewers can filter by tags to see a select number of events.
- Attendees can rsvp to events and get reminder emails/messages.
- Event Planners can create/update/delete events.
- Events will have Titles/Description/Time/Location/Image
