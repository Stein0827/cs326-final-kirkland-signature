# Part 0: Data Interactions
2 types of Users: Signed-In users and Signed-Out users.
- Map is shown on main page irrespective of user type.
- Map has pins, which can be clicked on by any user to open a pop-up with information about the event they clicked on.
- Each event has multiple types of data: the event title, description, location (address), time of event, and image(s), visible to all types of users.
- Signed-In Users can go to event creator page to be able to edit all of the above data types for events they have made. 
- Each event will have number of people already RSVPed for the event, shown only to Signed-In users. Signed-In users will be able to click to RSVP themselves. This data can not be edited by the Signed-In users.

The main page will have a map, which has pins relating to events on it. The white rectangle on the right side of the page is where the user will be able to see the information about the event they clicked on. The button on the top left is for creating events, and will only be available to users who are Event Planners. This button will take the user to a event creator page which will have a form for the user to input information.
