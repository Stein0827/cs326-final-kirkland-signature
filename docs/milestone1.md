# Part 0: Data Interactions
3 types of Users: Event Planner (signed-in), Attendee (signed-in), and Viewer (signed-out).
- Map is shown on main page irrespective of user type.
- Map has pins, which can be clicked on by any user to open a pop-up with information about the event they clicked on.
- Each event has multiple types of data: the event title, description, location (address), time of event, and image(s), visible to all types of users.
- Event Planners can go to event creator page to be able to edit all of the above data types for events they have made. 
- Each event will have number of people already RSVPed for the event, shown only to signed-in users. Signed-in users will be able to click to RSVP themselves. Event Planners cannot edit this data.
